# To-Do List
![Layout](./images/layout.png)

This application demonstrates the use of jQuery to dynamically display information on the screen as the user interacts with it and to control inputs. It functions as a to-do list where the user can input a new task along with its start and end dates (description is optional). The user can utilize expand arrows to view or hide the task details. Once a task is completed, the user can click on it to cross it off the list.
